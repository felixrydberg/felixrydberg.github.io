I started working with Starweb the summer before my last school year began.
While still attending school I've had the chance to learn how to work with larger
projects. This includes how to manage tasks with a kanban board, an understanding
of github automated workflows, automated testing, code reviewing plus insight of
the technology used to run a large platform.
My assignments have consisted of Javascript solutions for our merchants and
miscellaneous platform tasks.
- The Javascript solutions range from small behavioral changes to bigger scripts
where we have to take full advantage of the platform provided features to
reach functionality that the merchant requests.
- My platform tasks have been to implement new features. Everything from
small widgets for payment systems to a dashboard in Vue.

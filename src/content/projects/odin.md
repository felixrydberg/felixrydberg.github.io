This project was the start of an application where we would sync events between a specific discord server and the website. This was to allow for better UX when creating events and managing them (Assign groups and Roles to players). This project uses [Discord Markdown](/projects/discord-markdown) to show titles, lists ect.

This project was never published even though it was almost complete. We ran into issues with event recurrsion. We instead pivoted to building a Static site that displayes the latest news.
